# Hands-on_Lecture_2
The repository includes the two java files, this read-me file, and a test-case file, all under the Hands-on_Lecture_2 repository.

The first problem being solved is Pascal's triangle, where the 2 side by side numbers in a triangle are added up to the number directly under between them. 
The second problem being solved is the Spiral Matrix, where it gets a 2d matrix of numbers, and prints out the output as if they were being counted in a rightward spiral, until it reaches a stopping point.
